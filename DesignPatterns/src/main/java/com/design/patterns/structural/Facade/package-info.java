package com.design.patterns.structural.Facade;
/*
The Facade Pattern has three main components:

Facade: Gives clients access to basic methods that transfer the call to the methods 
of existing system classes. Subsystem Classes: The classes with which the facade 
communicates inside the complex system. Client: Uses the facade rather than making 
direct calls to the subsystem objects.

1. Deep Copy in Java

	When a deep copy is done objects referenced by the cloned object are distinct from those 
	referenced by original object, and independent.

	To create a deep copy while cloning an object you need to override clone method and call 
	clone() method for even the objects referenced by the cloned object.

	Deep copies are more expensive, as you need to create additional objects, and can be 
	substantially more complicated, due to references possibly forming a complicated graph.

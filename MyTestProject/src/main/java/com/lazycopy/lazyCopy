A lazy copy can be defined as a combination of both shallow copy and deep copy. 
The mechanism follows a simple approach â€“ at the initial state, shallow copy approach is used. 
A counter is also used to keep a track on how many objects share the data. 
When the program wants to modify the original object, it checks whether the object is shared or not. 
If the object is shared, then the deep copy mechanism is initiated.

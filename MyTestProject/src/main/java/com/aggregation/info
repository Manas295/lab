It is a special form of Association where:

- It represents Has-A relationship.

- It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. 
  For example, department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
  
- In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect 
  the other entity

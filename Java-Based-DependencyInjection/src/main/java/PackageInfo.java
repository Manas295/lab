	 * 1. Service components should be designed with base class or interface. It’s
	 * better to prefer interfaces or abstract classes that would define contract
	 * for the services. 
	 * 
	 * 2. Consumer classes should be written in terms of service
	 * interface. 
	 * 
	 * 3. Injector classes that will initialize the services and then the
	 * consumer classes.

Let’s understand above test class step by step:

-Annotate the test with the @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) so that mockito can process the annotations.

-Annotate the dao fields with the @Mock annotation to have a mock object instantiated for both of them.

-Annotate service field with the @InjectMocks annotation to first instantiate and then inject both mocked dependencies.

-Call the method to test on the class to be tested ie. recordService.

-Verify that methods in the mocked objects have been invoked.

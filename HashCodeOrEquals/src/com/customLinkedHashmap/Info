	LinkedHashMap in Java is also one of the implementation of the Map interface. 
	Apart from implementing Map interface LinkedHashMap also extends the HashMap class. 
	So just like HashMap, LinkedHashMap also allows one null key and multiple null values.

	In Java LinkedHashMap there are two options for ordering the elements-
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Insertion ordering- Insertion ordering means if you iterate a LinkedHashMap you'll get the keys 
	in the order in which they were inserted in the Map. Insertion ordering is the default ordering 
	in the LinkedHashMap. Note that insertion order is not affected if a key is re-inserted into the 
	map (if a same key in inserted more than once the last time it was inserted will be taken into account).

	Access ordering- Another option for ordering in LinkedHashMap is access ordering. Which means while 
	iterating order of iteration is the order in which its entries were last accessed, from least-recently 
	accessed to most-recently. A special constructor is provided to create a LinkedHashMap that follows access ordering. 
	If you pass true in that constructor then access ordering is followed
	
	
	How LinkedHashMap is implemented
	--------------------------------
	LinkedHashMap in Java is the Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface. 
	It maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries and that's how it maintains 
	the iteration order. Apart from maintaining a doubly linked list the internal implementation of the 
	LinkedHashMap is same as the internal implementation of the HashMap.
	
	Java LinkedHashMap Constructors
	-------------------------------
	LinkedHashMap()- Constructs an empty LinkedHashMap instance with the default initial capacity (16) and 
	load factor (0.75). Uses the default ordering which is insertion ordering.
	
	LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity)- Constructs an empty insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance with 
	the specified initial capacity and a default load factor (0.75).
	
	LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)- Constructs an empty insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap 
	instance with the specified initial capacity and load factor.
	
	LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, boolean accessOrder)- Constructs an empty LinkedHashMap 
	instance with the specified initial capacity, load factor and ordering mode. If ordering mode is passed as 
	true that means access-order, false for insertion-order
	(true, that means ordering mode is Access order[from least-recently accessed to most-recently".], 
	if passed as false that would mean ordering mode is insertion order.)
	
	LinkedHashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)- Constructs an insertion-ordered LinkedHashMap instance 
	with the same mappings as the specified map.
